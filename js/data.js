Artist Statement For my mural, I wanted to do something hopeful and bright, and the color palette reflects that intent. I took inspiration primarily from classical art and 70s prog rock album covers. I am a big fan of Roger Dean - the artist behind covers for bands such as Yes and Uriah Heep - and borrowed some of his themes for this piece. In the foreground, you see two statues in a colonnade, and as your eye moves across the piece into the mid and background, you become aware that the land and temple are breaking apart, with parts floating off into the sun. Th furthest statue has awakened and is stepping off of her base, gazing into the sun. Although the context - the solid ground she has been standing upon is breaking apart - should be frightening, she is looking into the light and moving towards her new existence. This is a metaphor for the process of being reborn in the breaking we all face in our lives, for waking up to the beautiful and terrifying reality of self, and becoming another thing and venturing into the unknown. Spatially, the piece unfolds for you as you round the corner approaching it. Your first view is of the static statues, and as you come closer, the rays of sunlight draw you in to the rest of the scene. There is not much room to stand back from the piece, so you are forced to confront its magnitude up-close, pulling you into the world in which it exists.',img:'images/2023/rhys-meatyard.jpg',from:'St. Petersburg, FL'},

Born in Miami, he is the product of both the ever-evolving, fast-paced city and the burgeoning art scene. Yet, he is as real and approachable as they come. In a city filled with wild characters and over-saturated personalities, Yanes is refreshingly humble, preferring instead to let his vibrant and colorful artwork take center stage. Since he decided to pursue art full-time in 2006, his work has become his autobiography, speaking volumes about who he is and what he has seen. A son of the city, his story is influenced by his Cuban roots and an ever-growing curiosity about all the things Miami had to offer him during the 80’s and 90’s. Yanes’ work is the result of years spent immersed in skateboard, tattoo, hip- hop and rock culture during his teenage years, but says he felt the stirrings of creativity at a young age. Whimsical and yet relatable, Yanes’ art embodies innovative use of color and imaginative subject matter and speaks to collectors and new art lovers, alike. His work has been a staple in Wynwood’s art district since it’s inception and has also been exhibited at by galleries in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Detroit, Philadelphia, London, Paris, Berlin, Australia and Japan. Artist Statement Intended to highlight how climate change is accelerating sea level rise, I was inspired to create a multi-level installation consisting of eighteen, precisely hand cut, panel pieces which create the image of a displaced fish when combined. The hand painted panels are meant to mimic an intricate jigsaw puzzle, representing the complicated interconnection of factors which comprise the cause and effects of sea level rise. By collectively doing our part to cut out fossil fuels and limit carbon emissions, we can “Rise Above” and reduce the impact of this inevitable threat. I have lived my whole life a stone’s throw from the shores of South Florida’s coastline. The ocean has always been a sacred place for me, providing an escape from everyday overstimulation, an outlet of awe, always leading to inspiration. During the last decade, the catastrophic effects of sea level rise have become ever more noticeable. I have seen destructive erosion, coastal and inland flooding, along with pollution from agricultural runoff causing toxic algae blooms leading to massive fish kills and habitat destruction. I grew up on my Dad’s boat exploring Biscayne Bay surrounded by its abundance of dolphins, manatees and sea turtles. I revisit the same spots with my daughters today and am faced with the sad realization that we are losing this complex and very fragile ecosystem. I still have hope in mankind and our ability to reverse the effects of climate change. As a parent, I am obligated to leave my children a planet that is safe.',img:'images/2020/alex-yanes.jpg',from:'Miami, FL'},
