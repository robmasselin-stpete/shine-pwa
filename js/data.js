His painting style, heavily influenced by the post-impressionistic period but with the use and reinvention of new materials commonly found in hardware shops, has earned him international acclaim as a contemporary muralist and figurative painter. Central to Jarus's art is the exploration of human emotions and experiences, stepping beyond traditional realism to engage deeply with figurative expression. His innovative use of materials in art highlights his commitment to not only aesthetic beauty but also practical ingenuity and sustainability. He aims to observe life, interpret it, and reflect these observations in his murals.

His earlier large-scale paintings often inhabited the isolated, abandoned and broken corners of the city, and today are found all over the world including in London, Vienna, Los Angeles, Miami, Atlanta, Buenos Aires, Copenhagen, Moscow, Rome, Jordan, and Dublin amongst others. Magee's practice is informed by a profound interest in political murals, inspired by exposure at a young age to those of his Father's native Northern Ireland. This is reflected in the socialist nature of his public art-works, which combine journalistic elements with public art. Magee's work is driven by his recognition of the power of murals to communicate political and social viewpoints and thus divide or unite communities. Drawing from personal experience and the mundane, his figurative paintings are deeply integrated with the urban environment and explore themes of diversity, migration and transition, waste and consumption, loss, and the environment.",

While committed to creating and showing art, they also split their time working as a freelance artist and illustrator, art director of a New Jersey design studio, and creative director for a small independent record label. Artist Statement For my mural, I wanted to do something hopeful and bright, and the color palette reflects that intent. I took inspiration primarily from classical art and 70s prog rock album covers. I am a big fan of Roger Dean - the artist behind covers for bands such as Yes and Uriah Heep - and borrowed some of his themes for this piece. In the foreground, you see two statues in a colonnade, and as your eye moves across the piece into the mid and background, you become aware that the land and temple are breaking apart, with parts floating off into the sun. Th furthest statue has awakened and is stepping off of her base, gazing into the sun. Although the context - the solid ground she has been standing upon is breaking apart - should be frightening, she is looking into the light and moving towards her new existence. This is a metaphor for the process of being reborn in the breaking we all face in our lives, for waking up to the beautiful and terrifying reality of self, and becoming another thing and venturing into the unknown. Spatially, the piece unfolds for you as you round the corner approaching it. Your first view is of the static statues, and as you come closer, the rays of sunlight draw you in to the rest of the scene. There is not much room to stand back from the piece, so you are forced to confront its magnitude up-close, pulling you into the world in which it exists.",

    "bio": "When you first meet Alex Yanes, you are struck by how laid-back and approachable he is. Born in Miami, he is the product of both the ever-evolving, fast-paced city and the burgeoning art scene. Yet, he is as real and approachable as they come. In a city filled with wild characters and over-saturated personalities, Yanes is refreshingly humble, preferring instead to let his vibrant and colorful artwork take center stage. Since he decided to pursue art full-time in 2006, his work has become his autobiography, speaking volumes about who he is and what he has seen. A son of the city, his story is influenced by his Cuban roots and an ever-growing curiosity about all the things Miami had to offer him during the 80's and 90's. Yanes' work is the result of years spent immersed in skateboard, tattoo, hip- hop and rock culture during his teenage years, but says he felt the stirrings of creativity at a young age. Whimsical and yet relatable, Yanes' art embodies innovative use of color and imaginative subject matter and speaks to collectors and new art lovers, alike. His work has been a staple in Wynwood's art district since it's inception and has also been exhibited at by galleries in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Detroit, Philadelphia, London, Paris, Berlin, Australia and Japan. Artist Statement Intended to highlight how climate change is accelerating sea level rise, I was inspired to create a multi-level installation consisting of eighteen, precisely hand cut, panel pieces which create the image of a displaced fish when combined. The hand painted panels are meant to mimic an intricate jigsaw puzzle, representing the complicated interconnection of factors which comprise the cause and effects of sea level rise. By collectively doing our part to cut out fossil fuels and limit carbon emissions, we can \"Rise Above\" and reduce the impact of this inevitable threat. I have lived my whole life a stone's throw from the shores of South Florida's coastline. The ocean has always been a sacred place for me, providing an escape from everyday overstimulation, an outlet of awe, always leading to inspiration. During the last decade, the catastrophic effects of sea level rise have become ever more noticeable. I have seen destructive erosion, coastal and inland flooding, along with pollution from agricultural runoff causing toxic algae blooms leading to massive fish kills and habitat destruction. I grew up on my Dad's boat exploring Biscayne Bay surrounded by its abundance of dolphins, manatees and sea turtles. I revisit the same spots with my daughters today and am faced with the sad realization that we are losing this complex and very fragile ecosystem. I still have hope in mankind and our ability to reverse the effects of climate change. As a parent, I am obligated to leave my children a planet that is safe.",

    "bio": "Florida Brian Butler is a Miami based artist, who's life has been guided by music for multiple decades. He has serviced musicians and festivals across nearly every genre imaginable with custom branding, murals, merchandise and album artwork. His move to Miami was hinged entirely on once catching a really good Iggy Pop concert. From 2010 until the death of live music in 2020, he could be found in venues across the country illustrating concerts. His collection of Show Drawn concert sketches exceeds 2000 performances, and has been exhibited nationally with Superchief Gallery, Subliminal Projects, and Simmons University's Trustman Gallery. Artist Statement Carbon Punishment is a multimedia project designed to amplify the brutality of ocean acidification. Brian Butler (UpperHandArt) concepted the project while developing his St Petersburg, FL ocean advocacy mural. The phrase eludes to humanity's toxic relationship with carbon emissions, and the typography is a nod to Tampa Bay's death metal heritage. Each wall is accompanied by a brutal grindcore track, composed specifically for this mural. The tracks were written and produced by Miami metal-heads Ale Campos (Las Nubes) and Eric Hernandez (Wrong, Torche), and contain lyrics that carry the same biting message as each mural. The music component was supported by Liquid Death Mountain Water, as an extension of their #deathtoplastic environmental initiatives. One wall illustrates sea life using the colors of the pH spectrum. In which, the shells colored in acidic hues are riddled with polluted cracks and skulls. The other wall highlights the ecological collapse of the sea, and is paired with the project's namesake \"Carbon Punishment\". The project can be heard at carbonpunishment.bandcamp.com and seen at instagram.com/carbonpunishment About the Mural Carbon Punishment by Brian Butler takes up two walls of the single-story building at 1101 1st Avenue North. One part of the mural faces east, visible to oncoming traffic. The other section is around the corner, on the rear of the building and facing Arlington Avenue to the north. The mural is part of a multimedia painting-and-music project that’s designed, Butler says, “to amplify the brutality of ocean acidification.” Each wall has a music track to accompany it. The mural facing 11th Street, to the east, is 60 feet wide and 7 feet tall, beneath a row of high horizontal windows. A line of giant cartoon shells are painted in the colors of the PH scale, what scientists use to measure acidity. Starting on the left, the color is red – on the PH scale, that means highly-acidic. Heading toward the right, the colors become pink and orange as the acidity lessens. All these shells on the left half are drizzled in splotches of black, like oil slicks. Toward the center, the oily black spots fade away and the shells become yellow and green – meaning neutral – and on the right, the clean shells are bright blue, meaning fairly basic, the opposite of acid. That’s how the ocean naturally is, if it’s not being poisoned. On the far left of the mural, a dark pink scallop shell overlaps a red coral branch. The shell appears eroded, with pockmarks and a skull’s grinning face in black, worn into the surface. Next, two shells in shades of pink, then four in shades of orange. Two other skull faces are worn into these orange shells – echoing a jack o’lantern, or a mask.. As the shells become yellow, green and blue, and the water becomes healthy, small blue air bubbles float up between the shells. There are two shells in green and four in blue, on the healthy side of the wall – including a clam, a sand dollar, a starfish and a branch of coral. The wall around the corner, facing north, illustrates the ecological collapse of the sea. This wall is 28 feet long and 9 feet high. On the left, against a white background with oily black swirls, a large red crab with a black skull face crawls along the brown sea floor. On the right side of the wall, the words “Carbon Punishment” in scratchy gothic orange lettering on black, take up most of the image. A black and white fish skeleton lies on the brown sea floor. The phrase “Carbon Punishment” describes humanity's toxic relationship with carbon emissions. The typography is a nod to Tampa Bay's death metal heritage. Each wall is accompanied by a brutal grindcore track, composed specifically for this mural. You can find the soundtrack on your phone, at carbonpunishment.bandcamp.com [“carbonpunishment-dot-bandcamp-dot-com”]. The tracks were written and produced by Miami metal-heads Ale Campos [“AH-lay CAHM-pohs”] and Eric Hernandez, and contain lyrics that carry the same biting message as the murals. The music is an extension of their #deathtoplastic [“hashtag-death-to-plastic] initiatives. Brian Butler is based in Miami, and often works with musicians and festivals. His collection of live “Show Drawn” concert sketches was created at more than 2000 performances, and it’s been exhibited nationally. Title: Carbon Punishment",

    "bio": "Happy Mural Project is led by artist Alyssa Marie and her husband Braden. Alyssa is a fine artist originally from Colorado who relocated to St. Pete in early 2017. In a childhood art book Alyssa created at age 7, she drew a picture of a stick figure painting a canvas on an easel. The caption read “When I grow up I want to be an artsist” An “artsist” is exactly what that little girl would become. Alyssa has used oil paints to spread joy to collectors all over the globe. The Happy Mural Project began in an effort to expand this effect. While enjoying time in her studio, she felt as if her reach could even greater with large walls and giant sunflowers. She radiates happiness around everything and everyone she comes in comes in contact with. You will feel that energy with the walls of The Happy Mural Project. About the Mural This mural by The Happy Mural Project is at 4025 31st Street South, on two walls of the St. Pete City Theatre. A diverse array of enormous hands are holding giant sunflowers. The murals are 11 feet high, and wrap around the front left corner of the building. The mural on the front is 40 feet wide and faces east, toward busy 31st Street South. The one around the left side is 27 feet wide. It faces south, toward a small side parking lot. The background of both murals is four horizontal bands of blue. The deepest blue is at the bottom, fading into pale light blue toward the top. On the front wall, to the left of the main entrance, a row of six enormous hands rise up from the ground, each holding a giant gold sunflower. The pointed petals are deep gold at the center and lighter on the edge. And they’re realistic – they’re not always uniform, some petals are bent, or floppy, like a real sunflower. The six flowers point in six different directions. Most are looking up, toward the Sun. But one near the center is facing you. And the flower on the far right, looks back at the other flowers. The hands that hold the sunflowers are painted from the wrist up, and hand is different. The wall includes a mix of skin tones – browns, white and Black – and a mix of genders and ages. A child’s hand is on the far left. The mural continues around the left corner. On the left half of this wall is a large rectangular white card, framed on top and bottom by delicate green ferns, as if it’s held in place by the leaves. On the card in blue is the John Lennon quote, “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one.” “I’m a Dreamer” is larger, painted in flowing cursive letters. On the right half of this wall, two hands are clasped together – one Black, and one white, fingers interwoven in a moving gesture. These hands hold three giant sunflowers. The flower in the center points at you, and the flowers on the left and right are angled in those directions. Just below the right-hand flower is the signature of the Happy Mural Project – a gold vertical rectangle that’s visibly created by four stripes of paint – fatter where the brush starts and angling to a finer point as the brush runs out of color. The words “the” and “project” are in lowercase gold letters. “HAPPY MURAL” is larger, in light blue capital letters. The Happy Mural Project was sponsored by the Pinellas Community Foundation, and created during the 2020 pandemic by fine artist Alyssa Marie and her husband, Braden Everly. They create “paint-by-number” murals – drawing the outlines and and inviting other artists, and volunteers from the community, to help with the painting. All their murals feature bright sunflowers, representing happiness, joy and love. As their website says, “We are showering the walls of this beautiful Earth with giant sunflowers. We are a passionate couple that believes that happiness is a choice and we want to help the world smile.” Title: Hands of Change",

    "basedIn": "St. Petersburg, FL",
    "bio": "Jabari Reed-Diop, otherwise known as iBOMS is a 21-year-old artist based in St. Petersburg, Florida. His artistic acumen comes from personal experience and formal education at Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in Jacksonville. Despite constantly pushing his craft and experimenting with new mediums, iBOMS’ style is immediately recognizable. At first glance, his work may seem like simple illustrations or even graffiti, but each piece has a story to tell, a deeper message, a powerful statement about love, destruction, or discovery. His characters are complex and often represent aspects of his life as a young black male. Artist Statement For the Sea Walls x SHINE Mural Festival I was tasked with depicting harmful algal blooms, better known as red tide. I did this by using one of my signature characters by the name of Ashi. I use this character to pull from my past, growing up on the Southside of St. Pete and being molded into this hard, always ready for anything, kind of kid. Constantly being defiant, constantly throwing myself in the way of danger just for the fun of it. Since this was basically a grand showcase of my work I wanted to take it in another direction. So I decided to use my character’s attributes to do some good in my little world of cartoons. The piece depicts him in a body of water with these red flowers on top of the waves and the flowers are representational of the red tide algae organism. It’s almost bleeding into the water like tea. The wildlife underneath it is obviously being harmed. Ashi is soaking up all the toxins in the water and they’re turning into tattoos on his body and spewing from his nose and it's making him dizzy. So he transformed himself using his nature because he realized he can’t change the roof of his being but he can change how he decides to present that part of himself to the world.” About the Mural This mural by the artist iBOMS [\"eye-bombs”] is called Where the Bloom Begins , at 2324 Central Avenue, at the Grand Central Brewhouse. The mural is set back from the street and takes up the right half of this west-facing wall, 30 feet high and 36 feet wide. The background is bright yellow. The center of the image features one of iBOMS’ signature stylized cartoon-like characters, named Ashi, a young Black male drawn from the artist’s childhood in south St. Pete. “ASHI” is written in capital letters below his left eye. Towering over the wall, his back is to us, but he looks over his left shoulder and down. His skin is greyish, with a bright red nose, pink circles on his cheeks and dark grey tattoos on his face, neck and back. His lips are an exaggerated blue-black with a red vertical stripe on the left. He wears a bright blue textured watch cap – two long black braids sneak out and dangle in front of his face. From his wide-mouth sneer, his teeth are a glittering silver, glinting in the sunlight. His eyes are blank white with big black X’s. He wears a heavy braided sliver necklace that glitters like his teeth. On the back of his neck, the clasp reads “iBOMS” in red letters. Ashi stands waist deep in water – the wavy white waterline starts a few feet from the bottom of the wall and his red plaid trousers and gold belt are muted, below the water. Clustered on top of the water is a thick red cloud of algae blooms, like invasive fat red flowers. The water is red, and there are three fish with their heads cut off, and an octopus with X’s on its skin, clustered around Ashi. The algae blooms are bobbing up around his body, and seem to irritate him – one on his left shoulder, a large one on his right, even a couple on his cap. The algae and the injured sea life are echoed in his tattoos, black and white outlines of algae and dead fish. Across his shoulders are the words “harmful algae blooms.” “HARMFUL ALGAE” is smaller, in hand-written capital letters. “BLOOMS” is huge, also in capitals, spreading across his back in typeface. In the top-right corner of the wall is the artist’s signature. Jabari Reed-Diop], known as iBOMS, is 21-years-old and based in St. Petersburg. Using original characters and a variety of mediums, he challenges perceptions and creates new narratives, through the lens of his own life experience as a young African American male.

    "bio": "Mason Schwacke is a St. Petersburg artist with a passion for illustrative designs that focus on a playful color pallet. He blends street art with contemporary designs to deliver symbolic messages applicable to all ages. His designs may be interpreted as an assemblage of vibrant colors and characters derived from his imagination, surrounding environment, and life experiences. Artist Statement “Being that the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was heavily involved in the design process, I truly wanted to bring the scalloped hammerhead, giant manta ray, smalltooth sawfish, and whitetip shark to life with a vibrant, almost exaggerated color palette. It truly is nauseating that we are in a chapter of humanity where most people neglect what is going on in our seas and with nature in general. I wanted to create the composition that addressed serious issues while showcasing an optimistic glow. The small things that we can easily do in our daily lives hold the potential to amount to something so much larger than ourselves. Even if this piece turns a few heads, people look up the PixelStix info, open a few closed minds, I think it is worth every ounce of effort. Our children and our children's children deserve to have a healthy planet to grow on. Without our oceans, they will have nothing.” – Mason Schwacke NOAA Fisheries is honored to sponsor the Protected Sharks and Rays mural for the 2020 St. Petersburg Arts Alliance’s SHINE Mural Festival which is being held in conjunction with the PangeaSeed Foundation’s Sea Walls Program. NOAA Fisheries’ Southeast Regional Office is, among other things, responsible for the conservation and recovery of threatened and endangered species as listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. This mural aims to highlight four species of elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) that our agency protects. Each of these four species have skeletons composed of cartilage rather than bone and each face various threats from humans. Smalltooth sawfish populations have declined to the point the species is currently in danger of extinction. Giant manta ray, scalloped hammerhead sharks, and oceanic whitetip sharks are threatened species, meaning that if declines continue, they too will be in danger of extinction. We very much appreciate local artist Mason Schwacke whose incredible design exceeded our vision. We look forward to sharing information on the plights of these 4 species with the public, in hopes of raising awareness and conservation. We are all stewards of the environment and this mural is an innovative form of outreach to inspire all to do their part. https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/ About Sharks and Rays The smalltooth sawfish, giant manta ray, oceanic whitetip shark, scalloped hammerhead shark are found in the southeastern United States and are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Sharks, skates, and rays are cartilaginous fish—known as elasmobranchs. Many elasmobranchs live in temperate and tropical oceans. They play an important role in ocean ecosystems. Sawfish and many sharks are top-level predators that help keep ecosystems in balance. Manta rays, whale sharks, and basking sharks are lower-level consumers that feed upon types of plankton. These planktivores are important indicators of ocean health, regulate plankton abundance and community structure, and promote nutrient cycling with their diving behavior. Threats ESA-listed elasmobranchs face many threats, including overharvest and incidental capture (bycatch) in fisheries, pollution, and habitat loss. They are particularly vulnerable to population declines because they grow slowly, mature late, and produce few young. Commercial fishing is an imminent threat to protected elasmobranchs due to high demand for shark and ray products, such as fins, meat, oil, and gill plates. Additionally, millions of sharks and manta rays are incidentally captured and killed in global fisheries every year. Ocean pollution affects all marine life. Ocean debris (e.g., ropes, netting, plastics) can entangle elasmobranchs, causing injury or death. Microplastic particles from degrading plastic waste are ingested and accumulate in the body, especially in filter feeding manta rays. Habitat loss is a significant threat affecting sawfish populations throughout their range. Young smalltooth sawfish rely on shallow estuarine habitats fringed with vegetation, especially red mangroves, as nursery areas. Coastal development, especially in Florida, has changed or destroyed much of this habitat. This reduces sawfish nursery habitat and juvenile survival. How You Can Help ● Buy sustainable seafood: The United States has some of the largest and most sustainable fisheries in the world—both wild-caught and farmed seafood. Learn more at FishWatch.gov. ● Reduce Ocean Trash: Pick up litter and dispose of it in trash containers, and participate in coastal cleanups. ● Respect: Always view these animals respectfully. Never chase, feed, or touch these animals in the wild. It can be harmful and dangerous to them, and you. ● Become a Citizen Scientist: If you see one of these rare species, please report your sighting to NOAA. Meet the Species Giant manta ray (Mobula/Manta birostris) Fun Fact: Manta rays have huge brains (the biggest of any fish!) with developed areas for learning, individual recognition, and problem solving Status: Threatened Size: World’s largest ray, up to 29 feet wide (~9 m); at birth 6-8 ft (1-2 m) Habitat: Open waters and productive coastal areas Diet: zooplankton (tiny organisms that float along ocean currents) Oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) Fun Fact: The tips of their fins are rounded which is atypical for sharks Status: Threatened Size: Up to 11.25 ft (~3 m) Habitat: Offshore in the open ocean, on the outer continental shelf, or around oceanic islands in water depths greater than 600 ft - preference for surface waters Diet: Bony fishes, cephalopods (squids, octopi, cuttlefish), sometimes sea birds, other sharks and rays, and marine mammals Smalltooth Sawfish (Pristis pectinata) Fun Fact: The 22-29 teeth on each side of a sawfish’s snout (rostrum) are not true teeth, they are modified scales that are used to attack prey Status: Endangered Size: Up to 16 ft (~5 m) Habitat: Estuaries and nearshore coastal waters Diet: Primarily fish Scalloped Hammerhead - Central and Southwest Atlantic population (Sphyrna lewini) Fun Fact: Their hammers are called cephalofoils and they contain sensory receptors to help detect prey Status: Threatened Size: Up to 11 ft (~3.3 m) Habitat: Intertidal coastal waters to open ocean depths of 1,600 ft Diet: Fish, cephalopods, crustaceans (shrimp and crabs), and rays About the Mural “Being that the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was heavily involved in the design process, I truly wanted to bring the scalloped hammerhead, giant manta ray, smalltooth sawfish, and whitetip shark to life with a vibrant, almost exaggerated color palette. It truly is nauseating that we are in a chapter of humanity where most people neglect what is going on in our seas and with nature in general. I wanted to create the composition that addressed serious issues while showcasing an optimistic glow. The small things that we can easily do in our daily lives hold the potential to amount to something so much larger than ourselves. Even if this piece turns a few heads, people look up the PixelStix info, open a few closed minds, I think it is worth every ounce of effort. Our children and our children's children deserve to have a healthy planet to grow on. Without our oceans, they will have nothing.” – Mason Schwacke NOAA Fisheries is honored to sponsor the Protected Sharks and Rays mural for the 2020 St. Petersburg Arts Alliance’s SHINE Mural Festival which is being held in conjunction with the PangeaSeed Foundation’s Sea Walls Program. NOAA Fisheries’ Southeast Regional Office is, among other things, responsible for the conservation and recovery of threatened and endangered species as listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. This mural aims to highlight four species of elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) that our agency protects. Each of these four species have skeletons composed of cartilage rather than bone and each face various threats from humans. Smalltooth sawfish populations have declined to the point the species is currently in danger of extinction. Giant manta ray, scalloped hammerhead sharks, and oceanic whitetip sharks are threatened species, meaning that if declines continue, they too will be in danger of extinction. We very much appreciate local artist Mason Schwacke whose incredible design exceeded our vision. We look forward to sharing information on the plights of these 4 species with the public, in hopes of raising awareness and conservation. We are all stewards of the environment and this mural is an innovative form of outreach to inspire all to do their part. https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/ Title: Prosperitas",

    "bio": "Florida Nneka Jones: Growing up in the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago to be exact, was one of the main factors that has molded Nneka Jones into the artist she is today. Her astounding love for color and special attention to detail, as influenced by her culture, have always been prominent throughout her artistic journey. The twenty-three-year old artist has graduated with a BFA and minor in Marketing from the University of Tampa in May 2020. Her most recent achievement was a commission from TIME magazine to produce the cover artwork for the August 31st/ September 7th issue 2020. The artist is now speaking at events like Adobe MAX, inspiring others by sharing how she turned her doubts, into dreams, and made those dreams into reality. She uses her artwork as a to speak out against social injustices that are overlooked in everyday life. Bianca Burrows: Bianca Burrows is a mixed media commercial artist based in Tampa, Florida. Whether she is painting on a traditional canvas, or crushing massive walls with stencils and a spray can, her work is intentionally customized for each customer. BBArt merges traditional acrylic paints with a variety of unique materials, such as custom-designed stencils and collage paper to create a unique and recognizable style which is best described as refined NY street-art. Her signature approach to street-art is visible in all of Bianca’s pieces.. Bianca draws on the inspiration of her clients’ visions and her personal creativity to create these vibrant, crisp, bold pieces. In 2019, Bianca created The Promise Tree Project to give kids a creative outlet and a safe space to work on self-expression through art. Notable clients include Mercedes Benz, Bloomingdales, Refinery 29, Lululemon, Land Rover and the MLB. Artist Statement The Global Currency is a collaborative mural executed by combining the artistic styles of the two artists, Bianca Burrows and Nneka Jones. Bianca’s commercial art style married with Nneka’s contemporary approach to activism creates the perfect recipe to generate change. The 33’8 x 10’3 mural emphasize the importance of painting for a purpose and how art can be used to enforce active change within the community. The artists chose to focus on the topic of “overfishing” as this is often overlooked and minimalized, leading to a society that is driven by greed and the increase of extinction of different species. This concept is highlighted in a narrative style using symbolism and a high contrast color scheme. With the viewer’s eyes beginning at the far right of the mural, the artists use fish and dollar bills interchangeably that appear to be bursting out of an overflowing fish net. The tight grip of the oversized human hand emphasizes the concept of greed driving these actions, which is only doing more harm to our oceans and the environment in the long run. The concept then leads into mother nature who is not only camouflaged by the high contrast color scheme but appears to be diminished as she looks directly at the viewer. The red-orange surrounding her hair as well as within her face symbolize “danger” and the need for us to preserve our land and oceans. Hence, the final portion of the mural to the far left calls for the viewer to self-reflect using the flower inspired by a lotus flower. It uses the calm blue and teal to reinforce that our oceans and species need to be protected and it starts with you. This allows the viewer to recall what they have done and what they can do to create positive change for our oceans and environment. Moreover, once viewed as a whole and each section of the narration comes together, the mural reflects that of a dollar bill and proclaims that this is the “price” we will all pay if we continue on the path of destruction, i.e. “The Global Currency.” The artists hope that this can be internalized beyond its aesthetic value and help the city of St. Petersburg and wider areas to understand the truth behind #paintingwithapurpose. About the Mural Tampa-based visual artist Nneka Jones is collaborating with mixed media artist Bianca Burrows to paint a mural on the topic of overfishing. Jones is best known for her highly-detailed embroidery work which was recently featured on the cover of TIME magazine. She is also an accomplished painter, photographer and mixed media artist. Inspired by her native country, Trinidad and Tobago, her artwork reflects rich Caribbean tones and often advocates for issues of social justice. Title: The Global Currency",

On both canvas and walls, Suarez’s work is rich with symbols from her Brazilian and El Salvadorian heritage, juxtaposing the beautiful with the exotic to create enchanted narratives. The natural mythology and folklore from her respective parent cultures influence her work, from the indigenous face paint and adornment used to the rich and tropical color palettes of the South American landscape. Tati is a headlining muralist, having participated in Sea Walls projects around the world and other notable festivals like POWWOW! Artist Statement My mural is inspired by two local Floridian species who are at risk: mangroves and manatees. Mangroves are tropical trees found along salty, coastal waters. They are vital to both marine life and local communities. Mangrove forests provide storm protection to coastal communities. They act as buffers toward storm surges and help with erosion. These ecosystems are also a critical solution in the fight against climate change as they can be up to 10 times more efficient at absorbing and storing carbon long term. Most importantly, they create critical habitats and nurseries for various species of marine life, one of which is the manatee. Manatees face numerous threats such as boat collisions, habitat loss, and harmful algae blooms. I painted this mural to bring some love, color, and appreciation to St. Pete and to help bring awareness and promote mangrove conservation and regrowth. About the Mural Miami visual artist Tatiana Suarez’s mural is on the topic of mangroves and manatees. This mural is sponsored by Ocean Conservancy. Suarez is known for her ethereal feminine creatures, brought to life in pop surrealist style. Her work has been featured in galleries across the country, including San Francisco’s Spoke Art.
